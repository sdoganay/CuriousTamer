# CuriousTamer
This project is developed as a Ozyegin University-CS329-Term Project. It aims to tame your loving ones on why they shouldn't be checking any other photograph when you show them only one. It takes some of the selected photos from gallery and randomly adds a blood curdling hellish image with sounds, a perfect gif to scare the curious. In the meantime, it will take a picture and make it ready to share online. 
CuriousTamer will teach your friends and family about privacy.

*P.S. This project is my first swift project! :)
